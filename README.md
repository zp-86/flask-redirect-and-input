# flask-redirect-and-input
Little test project for me to experiment with buttons and redirects using flask

Uses flask, random and requests, all of which can be installed from pip.

Just run the main.py file. There are also some secret menus, read the code to find out how to get to them.
(Also make sure you have the html files in a folder nammed templates)
